# SDSS-V-SimTargets
Python Notebooks used in creating input files for SDSS-V Simluations

All Sky Targets for Simulation are in the allsky directory. If you would like
to play the home edition of the target simulation game, you can download the
target files, cadence files and the whole workspace directory. They are all on
the utah servers in the directory: /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/sdss10/sdss5/target/mocks/raw/version01/Downloads
